### Question
1. A classic example of a non-stationary series is the daily closing IBM stock price series (data
set ibmclose). Use R to plot the daily closing prices for IBM stock and the ACF and PACF. Explain how each plot shows that the series is non-stationary and should be differenced.

  ```r
  library(fpp)
  library(seasonal)
  library(fpp2)
  
  ibmclose
  help(ibmclose)
  tsdisplay(ibmclose)
  
  #Closing IBM stock price
  autoplot(ibmclose)
  ```

  ggAcf(ibmclose)
  ```
