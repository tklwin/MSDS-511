### Question
1. A classic example of a non-stationary series is the daily closing IBM stock price series (data
set ibmclose). Use R to plot the daily closing prices for IBM stock and the ACF and PACF. Explain how each plot shows that the series is non-stationary and should be differenced.

    ```r
    library(fpp)
    library(seasonal)
    library(fpp2)
    
    ibmclose
    help(ibmclose)
    tsdisplay(ibmclose)
    
    #Closing IBM stock price
    autoplot(ibmclose)
    ```

    ```r
    # ACF plot
    ggAcf(ibmclose)
    ```

    ```r
    #PACF plot
    ggPacf(ibmclose)
    ```

    **[Answer]** By seeing, the plots, there is downward trend. So, `ibmclose` time series is non-stationary.

3. Consider austa, the total international visitors to Australia (in millions) for the period 1980-2015. Use auto.arima() to find an appropriate ARIMA model. What model was selected. Check that the residuals look like white noise. Plot forecasts for the next 10 periods.
Plot forecasts from an ARIMA (0,1,1) model with no drift and compare these to part a. Remove the MA term and plot again.
Plot forecasts from an ARIMA (2,1,3) model with drift. Remove the constant and see what happens.
Plot forecasts from an ARIMA (0,0,1) model with a constant. Remove the MA term and plot again.
Plot forecasts from an ARIMA (0,2,1) model with no constant.
