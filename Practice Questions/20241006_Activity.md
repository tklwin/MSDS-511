### Question
1. A classic example of a non-stationary series is the daily closing IBM stock price series (data
set ibmclose). Use R to plot the daily closing prices for IBM stock and the ACF and PACF. Explain how each plot shows that the series is non-stationary and should be differenced.

    ```r
    library(fpp)
    library(seasonal)
    library(fpp2)
    
    ibmclose
    help(ibmclose)
    tsdisplay(ibmclose)
    
    #Closing IBM stock price
    autoplot(ibmclose)
    ```

    ```r
    # ACF plot
    ggAcf(ibmclose)
    ```

    ```r
    #PACF plot
    ggPacf(ibmclose)
    ```

    **[Answer]** By seeing, the plots, there is downward trend. So, `ibmclose` time series is non-stationary.

2. Consider austa, the total international visitors to Australia (in millions) for the period
1980-2015.

    (a) Use auto.arima() to find an appropriate ARIMA model. What model was selected. Check that the residuals
    look like white noise. Plot forecasts for the next 10 periods.
    
    ```r
    #Total international visitors to Australia (in millions). 1980-2015.
    austa
    help(austa)
    autoplot(austa)+
    xlab("Year 1980-2015") + ylab("international visitors to Australia (in millions)")
    ```
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3237fb0-6cdc-4cdd-aec1-3f4a34aa8fd8)
    
    ```r
    #using ARIMA model, fit is auto model
    fit <- auto.arima(austa, seasonal=FALSE)
    fit

    #forecast using ARIMA
    fit %>% forecast(h=10) %>% autoplot(include=80)
    #checking residuals
    checkresiduals(fit)
    ```

    (b) Plot forecasts from an ARIMA (0,1,1) model with no drift and compare these to part a. Remove the MA term and plot again.

    ```r
    # for ARIMA(0,1,1) without drift
    fit2 <- Arima(austa, order=c(0,1,1))
    fit2
    autoplot(forecast(fit2))
    ```
    (c) Plot forecasts from an ARIMA (2,1,3) model with drift. Remove the constant and see what happens.

    (d) Plot forecasts from an ARIMA (0,0,1) model with a constant. Remove the MA term and plot again.

    (e) Plot forecasts from an ARIMA (0,2,1) model with no constant.

```r
# for ARIMA(0,1,1) without drift
fit2 <- Arima(austa, order=c(0,1,1))
fit2
fit2 %>% forecast(h=10) %>% autoplot(include=80)+ ggtitle("Forecast from ARIMA(0,1,1) without drift")

# for ARIMA(0,1,0) remove MA
fit3 <- Arima(austa, order=c(0,1,0))
fit3
fit3 %>% forecast(h=10) %>% autoplot(include=80)+ ggtitle("Forecast from ARIMA(0,1,0)")

# for ARIMA(2,1,3) with drift
fit4 <- Arima(austa, order=c(2,1,3), include.drift = TRUE)
fit4
fit4 %>% forecast(h=10) %>% autoplot(include=80)+ ggtitle("Forecast from ARIMA(2,1,3) with drift")


# for ARIMA(2,1,3) without constant
fit5 <- Arima(austa, order=c(2,1,3), include.constant = FALSE)
fit5
fit5 %>% forecast(h=10) %>% autoplot(include=80)+ ggtitle("Forecast from ARIMA(2,1,3) without constant")

# for ARIMA(0,0,1) with constant
fit6 <- Arima(austa, order=c(0,0,1), include.constant = TRUE)
fit6
fit6 %>% forecast(h=10) %>% autoplot(include=80)+ ggtitle("Forecast from ARIMA(0,0,1) with constant")

# for ARIMA(0,0,0) remove ma
fit7 <- Arima(austa, order=c(0,0,0), include.constant = TRUE)
fit7
fit7 %>% forecast(h=10) %>% autoplot(include=80)+ ggtitle("Forecast from ARIMA(0,0,0) remove MA")

# for ARIMA(0,2,1) with no constant
fit8 <- Arima(austa, order=c(0,2,1), include.constant = FALSE)
fit8
fit8 %>% forecast(h=10) %>% autoplot(include=80)+ ggtitle("Forecast from ARIMA(0,2,1) with no constant")
