### Question
1. A classic example of a non-stationary series is the daily closing IBM stock price series (data
set ibmclose). Use R to plot the daily closing prices for IBM stock and the ACF and PACF. Explain how each plot shows that the series is non-stationary and should be differenced.

    ```r
    library(fpp)
    library(seasonal)
    library(fpp2)
    
    ibmclose
    help(ibmclose)
    tsdisplay(ibmclose)
    
    #Closing IBM stock price
    autoplot(ibmclose)
    ```

    ```r
    # ACF plot
    ggAcf(ibmclose)
    ```

    ```r
    #PACF plot
    ggPacf(ibmclose)
    ```

    **[Answer]** By seeing, the plots, there is downward trend. So, `ibmclose` time series is non-stationary.

2. Consider austa, the total international visitors to Australia (in millions) for the period
1980-2015.

    (a) Use auto.arima() to find an appropriate ARIMA model. What model was selected. Check that the residuals
    look like white noise. Plot forecasts for the next 10 periods. 
        ```r
        #Total international visitors to Australia (in millions). 1980-2015.
        austa
        help(austa)
        autoplot(austa)+
          xlab("Year 1980-2015") + ylab("international visitors to Australia (in millions)")
       #using ARIMA model, fit is auto model
        fit <- auto.arima(austa, seasonal=FALSE)
        fit
        
        #forecast using ARIMA
        fit %>% forecast(h=10) %>% autoplot(include=80)
        #checking residuals
        checkresiduals(fit)
        ```

    (b) Plot forecasts from an ARIMA (0,1,1) model with no drift and compare these to part a. Remove the MA term and plot again.
       ```r
       # for ARIMA(0,1,1) without drift
       fit2 <- Arima(austa, order=c(0,1,1))
       fit2
       autoplot(forecast(fit2))
       ```
    (c) Plot forecasts from an ARIMA (2,1,3) model with drift. Remove the constant and see what happens.
    (d) Plot forecasts from an ARIMA (0,0,1) model with a constant. Remove the MA term
    and plot again.
    (e) Plot forecasts from an ARIMA (0,2,1) model with no constant.
