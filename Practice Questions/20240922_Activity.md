### [Question 5](https://github.com/tklwin/MSDS-511/blob/main/Practice%20Questions/20240922_Activity.png)
Use the `ggseasonplot()` and `ggsubseriesplot()` functions to explore the seasonal patterns in the following time series: `writing`, `fancy`, `a10`, `h02` .
+ What can you say about the seasonal patterns?
+ Can you identify any unusual years?

```r
ggseasonplot(writing)
ggsubseriesplot(writing)
```
